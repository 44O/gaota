## Something like a poem

When I was a primary school student, I was an MSX user and I was constantly programming. At that time was at the PC boom, me and my friends were often wrote a programs and showed each other.

One day, one of such friends, T, said "I won't make this anymore so I'm gonna give you this game's idea". Oh, by the way T was a SEGA SC-3000 and SHARP PC-1245 user.

Anyway, what he'd been made so far was a program a dinosaur simply moves to the left and right.

So, I transcribed dinosaurs, rocks, walls and others on a grid papers and made hexadecimal data for dot picture. Also, I wrote some stage datas in the grid papers.

After all, however, I did not implement that game afterwards and lost interest in the program, and I turned to be a boy that does sports like a kendo and a rugby.

After a few decades, I find the pixel and what I thought was that "I might be able to implement that game's  idea at that time with pyxel".

So, this is what I wrote without understanding python and pyxel well.

Although it is still incomplete, please enjoy.
